    "This notebook will re-vist your **simulation** skills. We use simulation (as opposed to permutation testing) when we are testing a claim about whether some observed statistic is consistent with random chance, *but where we are using a single sample*. E.g. you'll remember from the [Robert Swain](https://lisds.github.io/textbook/iteration/reply_supreme.html) simulation, we tested whether getting a jury with 0 black jurors was consistent with random jury selection. This contrasts with permutation testing, where we are typically comparing *two groups/samples* e.g. [testing if Brexit voters are generally older than Remain voters](https://lisds.github.io/textbook/permutation/population_permutation.html), for instance.\n",

    "\n",
    "You draw, one by one, twenty cards from a deck. On each draw, your friend makes a guess as to the card's identity (e.g. Ace of Spades; 3 of Clubs etc.) before seeing the card. You then show them the true identity of the card, and then put the card back in the deck before the next draw. You both record the number of cards they correctly guessed.\n",

    "\n",
    ">One of his experiments involved the cards, which came 25 to a pack. Inside were five cards each of five different designs--a circle, cross, wave, square and star--chosen because each had one more line than the other. The back side of the card had a blue background with a design and a Duke building. Although Rhine did much of the research, he had Zener design the cards since Zener was a perceptual psychologist.\n",

    ">\n",

For example, to remove shuffling errors, he used a machine to shuffle cards. To eliminate the chance of card counting, he did not tell subjects if they were correct or not on a guess. To remove physical or facial cues, he put subject and experimenter in different rooms. In one test, he put a high performing subject and experimenter 250 yards apart.\n",
